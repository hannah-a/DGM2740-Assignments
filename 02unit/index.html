          There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space
          as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the
          best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many
          never come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our
          goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35
          years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          We choose to go to the moon. We cho ose to go to the moon in this
          decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because
          they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure
          the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one
          that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and
          one which we intend to win, and the others, too. <br />
          It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift
          our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important
          decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the
          Presidency.

          In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the
          greatest and most complex exploration in man's history. We have felt
          the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1
          booster rocket, many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched
          John Glenn, generating power equivalent to 10,000 automobiles with
          their accelerators on the floor. We have seen the site where the F-1
          rocket engines, each one as powerful as all eight engines of the
          Saturn combined, will be clustered together to make the advanced
          Saturn missile, assembled in a new building to be built at Cape
          Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure, as wide as a city block,
          and as long as two lengths of this field.
